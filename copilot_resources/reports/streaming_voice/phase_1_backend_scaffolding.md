# Phase 1 – Backend Scaffolding (Streaming Voice)

## Summary
Initial scaffold for streaming voice WebSocket endpoint created with mock transcription loop and session registry (in-module). Conditional feature flag integration added.

## Changes
- Added `backend/src/beautyai_inference/api/endpoints/streaming_voice.py`: WebSocket endpoint scaffold, session state dataclass, mock decode loop.
- Updated `backend/src/beautyai_inference/api/endpoints/__init__.py`: Conditional import & export of `streaming_voice_router` via VOICE_STREAMING_ENABLED flag.
- Updated `backend/src/beautyai_inference/api/app.py`: Conditional router inclusion with tag `streaming-voice`.
- Added progress tracking files under `planning/reports/streaming_voice/`.

## Metrics (Planned for Later Phases)
- Decode cycle jitter (target ±50 ms) – Not yet measured.
- Active connection count – Provided via `/api/v1/ws/streaming-voice/status`.

## Open Issues / Follow-ups
1. Add unit tests in later phases for session lifecycle.
2. Decide final namespace for future service modules (`services/voice/streaming/`).

## Next Steps
- Verify WebSocket connection manually after file creation.
- Proceed to Phase 1.5 once client preprocessor work begins.

## Rollback Strategy
Remove created file and environment flag usage; feature remains off when `VOICE_STREAMING_ENABLED=0`.
