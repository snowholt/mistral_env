# Phase 11: Unit & Integration Tests (Initial Layer)

## Goals
- Add foundational unit tests for new streaming components: ring buffer, endpointing, decoder loop.
- Provide safety net before further tuning / refactors.

## Added Tests
- `test_ring_buffer.py`: write/read, wrap truncation, RMS approximate check.
- `test_endpointing.py`: start + final via silence+stable tokens, max duration fallback.
- `test_decoder_loop_mock.py`: exercises incremental decode loop with dummy model ensuring partials emitted.

## Notes
- Decoder loop finalization depends on real RMS / endpoint conditions; test currently validates partial emission and structure without enforcing final transcript (kept flexible).
- Further integration tests (WS end-to-end) deferred to later sub-phase to avoid network dependencies in fast unit layer.

## Follow-Ups
- Add mock for endpoint RMS progression to force final transcript reliably.
- Add WebSocket integration test injecting PCM frames and asserting event order.
- Add metrics snapshot test (SessionMetrics) once metrics endpoint or exposure added.

## Status
Phase 11 initial test layer complete (foundational coverage). Ready to extend with integration tests in subsequent pass.
