=== VAD DEBUG LOG ===
Timestamp: Fri Aug  8 22:43:10 UTC 2025

=== PHASE 1: ISSUE IDENTIFICATION ===
Timestamp: Fri Aug  8 22:45:46 UTC 2025

CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE:
1. VAD trying to process individual WebM chunks: 'Input audio chunk is too short'
2. FFmpeg failing to decode chunk fragments: 'EBML header parsing failed'
3. System fallback to 'unclear audio /no_think' triggers infinite loop


=== CHUNK ACCUMULATION TEST RESULTS ===
Timestamp: 2025-08-08 22:47:21
Chunks sent: 0
Voice responses: 0
Duplicates: 0
WebM errors: 0
VAD errors: 0
Chunk accumulation working: False

=== PHASE 1 COMPLETE: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED ===
Timestamp: Fri Aug  8 22:49:24 UTC 2025

DETAILED ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
1. WebSocket receives individual MediaRecorder chunks (1024 bytes each)
2. System detects VAD is enabled, routes to process_realtime_audio_chunk()
3. Chunks are accumulated in chunk_buffer correctly
4. CRITICAL ISSUE: VAD service called with concatenated WebM but fails
5. Falls back to traditional processing of INDIVIDUAL chunks
6. Each chunk fails ffmpeg decode (EBML header parsing failed)
7. Each failure triggers 'unclear audio' fallback
8. Multiple 'unclear audio' responses create infinite loop

=== PHASE 2: ANALYSIS COMPLETE ===
Timestamp: Fri Aug  8 22:49:47 UTC 2025

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
1. Disable VAD processing for WebM chunks (VAD expects PCM/WAV)
2. Force time-based chunk accumulation for WebM streams
3. Process accumulated chunks as complete WebM files
4. Add proper WebM chunk validation before processing


=== VAD FIX VALIDATION TEST ===
Timestamp: 2025-08-08 22:53:53
Fix working: True
Infinite loop prevented: True
Voice responses: 1
Unclear audio count: 0
WebM errors: 0
VAD errors: 0

=== PHASE 3 COMPLETE: SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED ===
Timestamp: Fri Aug  8 22:54:22 UTC 2025

FIX IMPLEMENTED SUCCESSFULLY:
✅ WebM format detection and VAD bypass working
✅ Time-based chunk accumulation (30 chunks) working
✅ Complete WebM processing without individual chunk failures working
✅ No infinite loop - proper single response generated
✅ No VAD errors, no WebM parsing errors, no unclear audio fallbacks

PROBLEM SOLVED COMPLETELY!
