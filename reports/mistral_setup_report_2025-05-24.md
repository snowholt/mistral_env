# BeautyAI Setup Project Report
**Date:** May 24, 2025
**Author:** Lumina

## Project Overview
This report provides a detailed analysis of the BeautyAI model setup project found in `/home/lumi/beautyai/`. The project aims to run the Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Instruct-2503 model on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU using appropriate quantization techniques to fit the model within the available VRAM.

## Current Project State

### Environment
- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 with approximately 24GB VRAM
- Python version: 3.12.3
- Virtual environment: Created and populated with necessary packages

### Files in the Project
1. `test_beautyai.py`: A script to test the basic functionality of the model
2. `chat_beautyai.py`: An interactive chat interface for the model
3. `benchmark_beautyai.py`: A script to benchmark model loading and inference speed
4. `setup.sh`: A setup script that creates a virtual environment and installs required packages
5. `README.md`: Documentation with installation and usage instructions

### Current Issues Identified
1. **Authentication Problem**: The original code attempted to access `mistralai/Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Instruct` which requires authentication. We updated to use `mistralai/Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Instruct-2503` and logged in using Hugging Face CLI.

2. **Model Compatibility**: After updating the model name, we encountered an error with the transformers library:
   ```
   ValueError: Unrecognized configuration class <class 'transformers.models.mistral3.configuration_beautyai3.Mistral3Config'> for this kind of AutoModel: AutoModelForCausalLM.
   ```
   
3. **Library Versions**: We updated the transformers library to the latest development version from GitHub, but compatibility issues may still exist.

### Next Steps
1. **Consider vLLM Implementation**: Based on the model documentation, vLLM is the recommended approach for running this model. We should consider modifying the scripts to use vLLM instead of transformers directly.

2. **Update Python Scripts**: Each script needs to be updated to properly handle the Mistral3Config model type with the appropriate libraries.

3. **Testing Quantization Options**: The current setup is using 4-bit quantization, which should be validated to confirm it works with the updated model version.

4. **Dependency Management**: The setup.sh script should be updated to include all necessary packages like vLLM if we decide to use it.

## Recommendations

1. **Use vLLM for Inference**: Based on the model card information, vLLM is the recommended approach for running this model. This will likely provide better performance and fewer compatibility issues.

2. **Test with Different Quantization Levels**: Consider testing with both 4-bit and 8-bit quantization to find the optimal balance between memory usage and performance.

3. **Create Simple Test Cases**: Develop simple test cases to verify model functionality before moving to more complex applications.

4. **System Prompt Template**: Update the prompt template to match the recommended format for Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Instruct-2503, which uses the V7-Tekken format:
   ```
   <s>[SYSTEM_PROMPT]<system prompt>[/SYSTEM_PROMPT][INST]<user message>[/INST]<assistant response></s>[INST]<user message>[/INST]
   ```

## Conclusion
The project has a solid foundation with well-structured scripts for testing, chat interaction, and benchmarking. The main challenges are related to model access and compatibility with the latest version of the Mistral model. By addressing these issues and potentially switching to vLLM, we should be able to successfully run the model on the available hardware.

The next phase of this report will detail the implementation changes and performance metrics once the model is successfully running.
