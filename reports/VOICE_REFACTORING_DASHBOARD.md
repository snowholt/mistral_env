## 🎯 **Key Decisions Made**

### **Step 1 Decisions (✅ Complete)**
- **Directory Organization**: Chose 3-tier structure (transcription/synthesis/conversation) for logical separation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained all existing imports through services `__init__.py` to ensure zero breaking changes
- **File Naming**: Renamed files but kept class names unchanged for Step 1 to separate concerns
- **Migration Strategy**: Used copy-then-update-then-remove approach for safety and validation

### **Step 2 Decisions (✅ Complete)**
- **Service Naming**: Adopted descriptive, purpose-driven names:
  - `WhisperTranscriptionService` - Clearly indicates Whisper-based STT
  - `UnifiedTTSService` - Emphasizes multi-engine TTS architecture
  - `AdvancedVoiceConversationService` - Highlights full conversation orchestration
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained all existing imports through alias system to ensure zero breaking changes
- **Import Strategy**: Used alias assignments (`AudioTranscriptionService = WhisperTranscriptionService`) for seamless transition
- **Codebase Updates**: Updated all core API endpoints and service imports while preserving existing test compatibility

### **Step 3 Decisions (✅ Complete)**
- **Service Architecture**: Implemented lightweight service without complex inheritance for maximum performance
- **Voice Mapping**: Created comprehensive voice mapping system supporting Arabic (Saudi, Egyptian) and English variants
- **Language Detection**: Used character-based heuristic for fast language detection (Arabic vs English)
- **Edge TTS Integration**: Direct integration without abstraction layers for minimal latency
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback system with clear error messages and cleanup procedures
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive unit tests with integration testing to validate Edge TTS functionality

### **Step 4 Decisions (✅ Complete)**
- **WebSocket Architecture**: Implemented streamlined WebSocket manager for real-time voice chat with minimal overhead
- **Connection Management**: Used global connection dictionary for simple state management and fast lookups
- **Performance Optimization**: Direct WebSocket message sending in connect method to minimize latency
- **Service Integration**: Direct integration with SimpleVoiceService without additional abstraction layers
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive test suite covering all connection lifecycle scenarios and error conditions
- **Resource Management**: Automatic service cleanup when no active connections remain, with intelligent delay for reconnections
