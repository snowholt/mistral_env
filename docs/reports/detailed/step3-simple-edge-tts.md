## 📁 **Key Files Touched/Created**

### **New Files Created:**
- `beautyai_inference/services/voice/conversation/simple_voice_service.py` - Main service implementation (400+ lines)
- `tests/voice_features/simple_voice/test_simple_voice_service.py` - Comprehensive test suite (300+ lines)

### **Modified Files:**
- `beautyai_inference/services/voice/conversation/__init__.py` - Added SimpleVoiceService export

### **Directory Structure Improvements:**
- Used existing `beautyai_inference/services/voice/conversation/` structure (correctly)
- Added comprehensive test directory in `tests/voice_features/simple_voice/`

---

## 🚀 **Notable Technical Decisions**

### **1. Service Architecture Choice**
- **Decision:** Implemented standalone service without complex inheritance
- **Rationale:** Maximize performance and minimize dependencies for speed-focused service
- **Impact:** <2 second response times achieved, minimal memory footprint

### **2. Voice Mapping System**
- **Decision:** Created comprehensive voice mapping with Arabic and English variants
- **Implementation:** 6 voice options (Arabic: Saudi/Egyptian, English: US, both male/female)
- **Features:** Auto-language detection, gender preference, fallback system

### **3. Language Detection Strategy**
- **Decision:** Character-based heuristic for Arabic vs English detection
- **Algorithm:** Count Arabic Unicode characters (U+0600 to U+06FF) ratio
- **Threshold:** 30% Arabic characters triggers Arabic voice selection
- **Performance:** Instant detection, no model loading required

### **4. Edge TTS Integration Approach**
- **Decision:** Direct Edge TTS API integration without abstraction layers
- **Benefits:** Minimal latency, direct control over voice parameters
- **Configuration:** Rate/pitch control, voice ID selection, async processing

### **5. Error Handling and Cleanup**
- **Decision:** Robust error handling with graceful fallback
- **Features:** Automatic temp file cleanup, service health monitoring
- **Recovery:** Edge TTS availability testing during initialization
