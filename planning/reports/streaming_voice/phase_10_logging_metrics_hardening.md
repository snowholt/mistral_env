# Phase 10: Logging & Metrics Hardening

## Goals
- Introduce lightweight per-session rolling metrics aggregation.
- Provide structured JSON logging (opt-in via VOICE_STREAMING_METRICS_JSON=1).
- Attach performance + endpoint stats to each session without external deps.

## Implemented Changes
### New Module
- `metrics.py`: `SessionMetrics` (decode_ms, cycle_latency_ms, end_silence_gap_ms) with rolling window + snapshot.

### Endpoint Integration
- `streaming_voice.py`: wires `SessionMetrics` into session state; updates on perf_cycle, endpoint_event, and final_transcript.
- Structured logs emitted after each final transcript and every 10 perf cycles (tagged `voice_stream_metrics` & `voice_stream_perf_cycle`).

### Decoder & Endpoint (from Phase 9)
- Existing instrumentation (decode_ms, cycle_latency_ms, end_silence_gap_ms) now feeding aggregator.

## Verification
- Syntax checks: no errors reported.
- Metrics objects instantiated per connection; do not persist after cleanup.
- Logging guarded by env flag; disabled by default to avoid noise.

## Performance Considerations
- O(1) updates; reservoir size 50 â†’ negligible memory per session.
- Logging frequency throttled (every final + every 10 cycles) to minimize I/O overhead.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Excessive log volume if flag enabled in prod | Disk churn | Throttled cycle logs + explicit env gate |
| Memory growth with many sessions | Minor | Each session holds small arrays (<= 3 * 50 floats) |
| Missing global aggregation | Limited cross-session insight | Future: central collector or Prometheus adapter |

## Follow-Ups
- Provide HTTP endpoint to fetch current session metrics snapshot (Phase 10 extension).
- Export counters to Prometheus (Phase 10b) behind optional dependency.
- Add histogram bucketing for decode_ms distribution.

## Conclusion
Phase 10 complete: metrics hardening establishes foundation for observability without external services. Ready for Phase 11 (tests) or optional metrics endpoint.
