# BeautyAI Web UI - Microphone Fix

## The Issue
Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) require HTTPS to access the microphone for security reasons. If you see the error "‚ùå Audio recording is not supported in your browser", it's likely because you're accessing the app via HTTP.

## Quick Solutions

### Solution 1: Use localhost (Immediate Fix)
Access your app via `http://localhost:5000` instead of `http://127.0.0.1:5000` or your IP address. Browsers allow microphone access on localhost without HTTPS.

### Solution 2: Enable HTTPS (Recommended)

1. **Generate SSL certificate:**
   ```bash
   cd src/web_ui
   python generate_ssl_cert.py
   ```

2. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   python start_ui.py
   ```
   
3. **Access via HTTPS:**
   ```
   https://localhost:5000
   ```

4. **Accept the self-signed certificate warning** in your browser (this is safe for development)

## What This Fixes

‚úÖ **Microphone access from any device**  
‚úÖ **Works with IP addresses (e.g., `https://192.168.1.100:5000`)**  
‚úÖ **Secure audio recording**  
‚úÖ **Better browser compatibility**  

## Browser-Specific Notes

### Chrome
- Will show "Not secure" warning for self-signed certificates
- Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)" to continue
- Microphone will work after accepting the certificate

### Firefox
- Will show "Warning: Potential Security Risk"
- Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Accept the Risk and Continue"
- Microphone will work after accepting the certificate

### Safari
- Similar warning for self-signed certificates
- Accept the certificate to enable microphone access

## Troubleshooting

### If microphone still doesn't work:

1. **Check browser permissions:**
   - Chrome: `chrome://settings/content/microphone`
   - Firefox: `about:preferences#privacy`
   - Ensure the site isn't blocked

2. **Clear browser cache and cookies**

3. **Try incognito/private mode**

4. **Check if another app is using the microphone**

5. **Test microphone at:** https://webcammictest.com/check-mic
